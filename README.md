🎓 Student Grade Management System

📘 Project Overview

The Student Grade Management System is a C# console-based application designed to help manage student records and their grades efficiently. The program allows users to add, display, search, and analyze student data using fundamental programming concepts such as data structures, control flow, functions, and exception handling.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of core C# programming principles and can serve as a foundation for building more advanced student management systems with a graphical interface or database integration.

🧩 Features

✅ Add a Student – Add a student's name and grade into a Dictionary<string, int>.

✅ Display All Students – View all stored students and their corresponding grades.

✅ Search for a Student – Search by name to find a student’s grade, or get notified if not found.

✅ Calculate Average Grade – Compute and display the average grade of all students.

✅ Find Highest and Lowest Grades – Identify and display the top and bottom grades in the system.

✅ Error Handling – Handles invalid inputs and missing data gracefully using try-catch blocks.

✅ User-Friendly Interface – Simple and clear console-based menu for easy navigation.
